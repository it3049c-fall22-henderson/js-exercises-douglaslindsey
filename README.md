## Self-Reflection:
<!-- What did you learn that you found interesting -->
I am brand new to Javascript this semester, so I am learning quite a bit of new information and sometimes a bit overwhelmed. It has a lot of similiarities between C# and HTML and Java. I am using my past with those and W3Schools to help me through these assignments. I had a few tests still not pass and I am unsure where to go from here with those but overall I think my code is solid. I just need a bit of review help to solidify it.
### How long it took you to finish this?
About 4-5 hours, not mentioning the 2-3 hours spent watching videos and reading about JS. I still have a LOT to learn.
